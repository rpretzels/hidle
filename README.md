# Hidle

ðŸ”— https://rpretzels.github.io/hidle/

A variant of the Mastermind-style game Word-Master from octokatherine
(https://octokatherine.github.io/word-master/).

The Hidle game makes life just a bit harder, by hiding one letter
randomly from each of your guesses.  For that letter, you won't
have a clue!

## Rules

You have 6 guesses to guess the correct word.

After submitting a guess, the letters will turn gray, green, or yellow.

- Green: The letter is correct, in the correct position.
- Yellow: The letter is correct, but in the wrong position.
- Gray: The letter is incorrect.
